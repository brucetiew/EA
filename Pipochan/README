Pipochan is a simplified version of the original turtle trading strategy.
1.  It ignores test on last theorethical close trade that checks whether or not an asset is over-cooked, upon which an entry signal shall be igonred.
2.  It enters and exits trades on the next tick on the Donchian channel by default when trade signal occurred.  The start shift signal is configurable via parameter DonchianStartShift.
3.  It ignores transaction costs such as commissions, bid-ask spreads and slippage for simplicity.
4.  It ignores transaction cost such as trade commision, spread and slippage.

Pipochan avoids lower timeframes that are smaller than 1 hrs to avoid dirty data that effect its performance. 
I had backtested pipochan on USDJPY from Jan 02, 2014 to May 05, 2016 with an initial amount of USD10,000 virtual money and saw it grew to USD59,282.  A whopping 4.9 folds returns in 2.5 years or 1.97 folds/year.
