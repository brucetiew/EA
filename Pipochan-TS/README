Pipochan-TS supports volatility-based trailing stop level.  Pipochan-TS manages its volatility-based stop level in two modes, hidden and recorded mode.
By default, the volatility trailing stop level is hidden, this is particularly useful if you do not want your broker, in particulr market maker, to know
what your stop level is.  If you like recorded mode, set the input parameter UseHiddenTrailingStop to false.

For hidden function to work, we need to run Pipchan-TS on "Every tick" backtest environment.
