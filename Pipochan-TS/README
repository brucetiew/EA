Pipochan-TS supports volatility-based trailing stop level.  It relies on Donchian Channel indicator for long and short entries decision, which can be downloaded from the indicators folder.
Pipochan-TS manages its volatility-based stop level in two modes, hidden and recorded mode.  By default, the volatility trailing stop level is hidden, this is particularly useful if you do not want your broker, in particulr market maker, to know what your stop level is.  If you like recorded mode, set the input parameter UseHiddenTrailingStop to false.

For hidden function to work, we need to run Pipchan-TS on "Every tick" backtest environment.
